Overview of the Project

Dataset: Uses the Beijing air quality dataset (2014â€“2019), which includes pollution data sampled every 10 minutes, resampled to daily frequency for practical forecasting. It also incorporates weather features like temperature and pressure.
Content:
Analysis: Exploratory data analysis to understand trends, seasonality, and patterns.
Transforms: Techniques like differencing or decomposition to prepare data for modeling.

Forecasting Models: Implements multiple models to predict air pollution levels, such as statistical methods (e.g., ARIMA) and potentially machine learning approaches.
